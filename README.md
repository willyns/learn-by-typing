Language learning tool
Web-based app which lets user to type the words or sentences in foreign (or their own, if they want to) language, not letting to make mistakes though - here, the Backspace key won't work in case if user made a typo. Instead, app will give a user the exercise which consists of the syllable where mistake was made and then the initial typing starts from the beginning
